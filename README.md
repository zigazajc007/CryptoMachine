# CryptoMachine

Chat with your friend without worrying that your ISP is spying on you or that your messages are being stored by companies that could sell data to the FBI and other unknown companies.

CryptoMachine **does not** store any data even on server. So only live chat is possible.

After server is closed all data will be removed from RAM.
